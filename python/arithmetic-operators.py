# Subtraction Operator : In Python,
#  â€“ is the subtraction operator.
#  It is used to subtract the second value from the first value

val1 = 2
val2 = 3

# using the subtraction operator
res = val1 - val2
print(res)

#5. Modulus Operator : In Python, % is the modulus operator.
# It is used to find the remainder when first operand is divided by the second.

val1 = 3
val2 = 2

# using the modulus operator
res = val1 % val2
print(res)

# 6. Exponentiation Operator : In Python,
# ** is the exponentiation operator. It is used to raise the first operand to power of second.

val1 = 2
val2 = 3

# using the modulus operator
res = val1 ** val2
print(res)

# 7. Floor division : In Python, // is used to conduct the floor division.
# It is used to find the floor of the quotient when first operand is divided by the second.

val1 = 81
val2 = 9

# using the floor division
res = val1 // val2
print(res)
